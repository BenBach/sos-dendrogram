<h1>Manual</h1>
<p>This plug-in allows you to play the contents of your SOM on multiple
speakers simultaniously using stereo soundcards installed on your system.</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions below.</p>

<h2>0 Command line parameters</h2>

<p>Make sure that you have set the parameters <b>p_decode</b> and <b>decodeDir</b> to
the desired values.</p>

<h2>1 Layout and position of speakers</h2>

<p>You have to fill in the position of each speaker into the <STRONG>
layout table</STRONG>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the desired number of columns and rows into the text fields.</li>
<li>Press <STRONG>Gen!</STRONG> to generate the layout table.</li>
<li>For each cell: enter the string identifying the speaker at this positon.<BR>
Examples:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Left speaker of the output line #2 (as shown in the list):<BR> 
    <STRONG>2L</STRONG></li>   
  <li>Right speaker of line #0: <STRONG>0R</STRONG></li>

  <li>The string is case insensitive (<STRONG>0r</STRONG> would be valid too.)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You can use the buttons <STRONG>Find me (loop)</STRONG> and
<STRONG>Find me</STRONG> to play soundclips so that you easily can identify
which speaker belongs to which output line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Assignment of SOM units</h2>

<p>Next you assign one or more SOM units to each cell of the layout table.</p>

<p>Optionally you can make the application do the assignment 
automatically. To do so, hit <STRONG>Automatic assignment</STRONG>.
If you prefer to do this manually or if you want to correct an automatic
assignment, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select one or more cells of the layout table.</li>
<li>Select one or more units in the SOMPane.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you select a layout table cell the units assigned to it will be 
highlighted. If you select a range of cells the union of the assigned units
will be highlighted.</p>

<h2>3 Save / load assignment</h2>

<p>You can save your current speaker layout and assignment 
to a file which you can load at a later
point of time. Use buttons <STRONG>Save</STRONG> and <STRONG>Load</STRONG>,
respectively.</p>

<!--p>The position of the speakers (0L, 1R, ...) will not be saved because
their order is not robust. That is, it might happen that after a 
restart of your computer the speakers changed their order. 
Also if you disconnect a (usb-)speaker and reconnect it later this may be
the case.</p-->

<p>Note that the order of the speaker in the list might change if
you restart your computer or if you dis- and re-connect a (usb-)speaker.
</p>

<h2>4 Playback</h2>

<p>If you are sure that the layout table, the assignment of
the SOM units and the preferences have been set correctly, 
start playback by pressing <STRONG>
Start playback</STRONG></p>
